# Warp transactions

Chainstack supports propagating your transaction through the high-speed [bloXroute transaction relay network](https://docs.bloxroute.com/bdn-architecture). The feature is called *Warp transactions*.

With the *Warp transactions* setting on, your transactions will be distributed in the Ethereum mempool through the high-speed transaction relay network. This will make your transaction be available for the validators to pick up and include in the block much faster than with the regular mempool propagation.
