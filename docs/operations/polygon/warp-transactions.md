# Warp transactions

Chainstack supports propagating your transaction through a high-speed block delivery network. The feature is called *Warp transactions*.

With the *Warp transactions* setting on, your transactions will be distributed in the Polygon mempool through the high-speed block delivery network. This will make your transaction be available for the validators to pick up and include in the block much faster than with the regular mempool propagation.
